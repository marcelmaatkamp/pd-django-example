# Practical docker tips
*Software does not live alone it is always a complex orchestration to get all the individual parts talk together. Luckily we have docker nowadays and in these talks I give examples on how to implement and secure a software stack with components like logging, monitoring, security, fault detection and more. See my [YouTube Channel with all episodes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxp65f-xyu4z1PvmZBKqZGQ) for more information.*

This project will be one of the main example applications, a Django application which will log to graylog, is secured by openxpki and traefik,

This will be the core software program in this example, a simple web applicaton in django to demonstrate how to secure, monitor, log and visualise data in this application. 

# dependencies
These are the dependencies of this project 

## openxpki

*OpenXPKI is an enterprise-grade PKI/Trustcenter software. It implements the necessary features to operate a PKI in professional environments. While primarily designed to run as an online RA/CA for managing X509v3 certificates, its flexibility allow for a wide range of possible use cases with regard to cryptographic key management.*

## dns

Each public facing container will get a unique hostname. This container will do the wildcard dns name resolution.

## traefik

https://docs.traefik.io/

*A reverse proxy / load balancer that's easy, dynamic, automatic, fast, full-featured, open source, production proven, provides metrics, and integrates with every major cluster technology. Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. Traefik integrates with your existing infrastructure components (Docker, Swarm mode, Kubernetes, Marathon, Consul, Etcd, Rancher, Amazon ECS, ...) and configures itself automatically and dynamically. Pointing Traefik at your orchestrator should be the only configuration step you need.*

Each public facing container will get a unique hostname and together with Traefik and LetsEncrypt also a unique SSL certificate.

## Watchtower

*Watchtower is an application that will monitor your running Docker containers and watch for changes to the images that those containers were originally started from. If watchtower detects that an image has changed, it will automatically restart the container using the new image.*

## graylog

https://www.graylog.org/products/open-source

*Graylog is purpose-built and designed to deliver the best log collection, storage, enrichment, and analysis experience.The simplicity in searching, exploring, and visualizing data means no expensive training or tool experts are required. Graylog has considerably faster analysis speeds, provides a more robust and easier-to-use analysis platform,*
